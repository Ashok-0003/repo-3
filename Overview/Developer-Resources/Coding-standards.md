**Technical Quality Check**

Technical Quality check (minimum) for API Implementations 
 

- Follow OOPS / SOLID principles while designing the classes / components. 
- Adhere to REST API practices such as Route Paths, HTTP Verbs, Versioning, Filtering and Pagination & Swagger
- Implement Telemetry and Instrumentation, includes logging, exception handling, performance metrics and usage data capture 
- Support Testability (Unit / API Testing)
- Design for Reliability (Availability, Performance and Scalability)
      1. Prefer Micro-services over monoliths.   
      2. Incorporate Cloud Design Patterns as applicable.  
- Meet Code Quality standards as per StyleCop, FxCop, SonarQube and other agreed linting tools
- Document Code: Capture necessary details, and check for grammar and spelling mistakes

**Naming Conventions:**
| Stack | Type | Additional Notes |
|--|--|--|
