1.	Registration
Remove the need for first and last name and only have need for email and password
-	Action: we need to confirm what is the minimum data that needs be captured at this point both for CRM and for MOTC (Microsoft to confirm)

2.	Service request
When the user will request a service that is when we prompt for a full detailed profile registration asking for additional details that have not been captured to date

3.	Marketing opt in
Add a checkbox statement to enable user to opt in for marketing emails – this may not be required but we will ensure we have design and space for this component for future use

4.	My profile
Asked for mobile number that has not been verified to be removed
-	Action: we will leave this in for now as from a UX point of view I have shared a mobile number but may not have validated with OTP so can do from profile page to avail any mobile notifications or services via mobile, This reduces the overhead of a user to have re-enter their mobile and waiting for OTP at that exact time. 

5.	Qatar address – profile 
To validate the address format for Qatar as currently UI shows Dynamics default fields 
-	Action: Microsoft to confirm Qatar address format and style, whether explicit fields or free text with PO Box
