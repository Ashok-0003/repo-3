•	Global Availability
TASMU Central Platform Architecture is designed from the ground to be accessible from anywhere, anytime. Built on top of Azure Cloud benefit from Azure Global Infrastructure - A region is a set of datacenters deployed within a latency-defined perimeter and connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network; A geography is a discrete market, typically containing two or more regions, that preserves data residency and compliance boundaries; Availability Zones are physically separate locations within an Azure region. Each Availability Zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.

•	Unlimited Scalability / Design for Scale Out 
Minimize coordination between platform components to achieve scalability. Design so that it can scale horizontally, adding or removing new instances as demand requires.


•	Secure by Design
Security is one of the most important aspects of any architecture. It provides confidentiality, integrity, and availability assurances against deliberate attacks and abuse of valuable data and systems. Microsoft TASMU Central Platform Architecture follows the Microsoft Security Design Principles. 

•	SaaS before PaaS before IaaS
IaaS before physical hardware (No hardware-based or hardware-dependent solution elements)

•	Configuration before Customization

•	Design for failure / No single point of failure 
Smart City Central Platform Redundancy to avoid having single points of failure. 

•	Design for self healing
In distributed systems, failures happen. Hardware can fail. The network can have transient failures. Therefore, the Smart City Central Platform is designed to be self healing when failures occur. This requires a three-pronged approach:
•	Detect failures.
•	Respond to failures gracefully.
•	Log and monitor failures, to give operational insight.

•	Loose coupling / Modular Design
The TASMU Smart City Platform is designed as a set of modules, that perform logically discrete functions, interacting through well-defined interfaces. The benefit of this approach is in reduction in cost (customization can be limited to a portion of the system, rather than needing an overhaul of the entire system), interoperability, shorter learning time, flexibility in design, non-generationally constrained augmentation or updating (adding new solution by merely plugging in a new module), and exclusion.

•	Design for Evolution / MicroServices Building Blocks for Cloud & Edge  
Smart City Central Platform will change over time. Evolutionary design is key for continuous innovation.



•	Best data store for the job 
Storage technology that is the best fit for data and how it will be used. Partition around limits. Partitioning to work around database, network, and compute limits. 

•	Design for operations. 
Smart City Central Platform Operations team have the tools they need. Some of the important functions of the operations team include and that TASMU Smart City Platform is designed for:
•	Deployment
•	Monitoring
•	Escalation
•	Incident response
•	Security auditing

•	Build for the needs of business / Solution Design aligned with Product Roadmap
Every design decision must be justified by a business requirement, Define Business Objectives, Capture both functional and nonfunctional requirements

•	Optimized for Cost
In a traditional on-premises application, upfront hardware cost and capital expenditure are required. In cloud solutions like the TASMU Smart City Platform, costs are adjusted to the business demand and resources consumed. 

•	Human-Centred Design principles 
Tiering decisions to validated problem statements from end-users (or representatives); Ease of use ; Inclusive Design principles ; Continuous validation of UX concepts with end-users outside of the project;  Enabling UC owners to benefit from the same principles when the platform is running
