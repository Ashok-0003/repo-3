# Data Source Connections
The Power Bi reports are connected to multiple data Sources. 
And in each report multiple tables are added via connection queries to their respective source. This operation is done manually. 
If there is an environment migration for instance, or a a resource change or else, to avoid redundancy of changing manually the connection query of each table we introduced parameters in Power Bi to dynamically change the dara sources.
