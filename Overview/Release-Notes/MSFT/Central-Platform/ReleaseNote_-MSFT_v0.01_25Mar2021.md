2.1	Known Issues:
a)	The localized content is being waited upon for approvals. As part of bug fix 34007, the below pop-ups were introduced. 

b)	As part the bug fixes (33000, 33158) the below pop-ups are introduced. Waiting for the approved localized contents of the pop-up and KB articles.  The content of the KB article is not approved however, the content of the pop-up is approved.                   
c)	As part of the 34007, subscription of the products and services with the existing credentials, is not possible, as the profiles lack the customer segmentation. Hence accordingly the data should be configured in CRM system.


3	‚≠ê Improvements
3.1	CMS
1.	 Waiting time of the trigger is decreased from 3 minutes to 1 minute so that approval process can be speeded up.
2.	Sync Sector function app will be triggered for every 24 hours, which was 5 minutes earlier, so that load is reduced.
3.	‚ÄúCopy CDN URL‚Äù functionality has been introduced in all document/image library so that CDN URL for contents can be copied with ease, which will increase the Usability. 
3.2	CRM
1.	Session affinity related setting change to compliment scale improvements being done at Dynamics (product) environment through support team.
Further performance testing should be done only after this release, as well as additional environment preparation. For CRM, the environment type must be of ‚Äòproduction‚Äô (not ‚Äòsandbox‚Äô), and dynamics web servers must be scaled out to minimum six servers to overcome API throttling (this can be done through product support request or ICM ticket). Both Platform APIs and CRM builds need to go for this performance improvement.
